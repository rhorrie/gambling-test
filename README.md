# gambling-test
*Currently in process of being built*
End goal is to have a running webpage that will display betting info for all major sports (MLB, NFL, NBA, NCAAF, NCAABB). I will then also create a script to analyze the data (wins, losses, opponents, etc.) that will output what the "best" bet of the day is for each sport. Currently, the hosting of the site is giving me lots of issues, so I am beginning to focus more on creating the script that will analyze the data each day.
